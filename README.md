# Malware Hunting – Dissecting PDF file

There are a large number of cyber threats today, many of these cyber threats can be based on malicious code, one of this code is known as Malware (Malicious Software or maldoc - Malicious Document ) to refer these kind of threats. The term Malware, is a generic term that covers all types of programs specifically developed to perform malicious actions on a computer, thus the term malware has become the name for any type of program specifically developed to perform harmful actions and malicious activities on a compromised system.
This paper presents an in-depth security analysis of the PDF features and capabilities, independently from any vulnerability. The aim is to exhaustively explore and evaluate the risk attached to PDF language-based malware which could successfully using different techniques in malware-based in PDF embedded. You’ll have the experience of understanding different kind of structures in the binaries as PDF such as header/ body/cross
reference table/trailer, explaining how each session works within a binary, what are the techniques used such as obfuscation, encodings with JavaScript (PDF) and more, demonstrating as a is the action of these malwares and where it would be possible to "include" a malicious code. By the end of this article it will be clear to everyone, how we got find C&C ( Command Control) in binaries structures, how can the researcher should conduct each of these kind of analyses, it should seek more basic knowledge, with file structures, software architecture and programming language.
